<p> &#39;But there are causes worth dying for,&#39; said Butterfly.</p>
<p>&#39;No, there aren&#39;t! Because you&#39;ve only got one life but you can pick up another five causes on any street corner!&#39;</p>
<p>&#39;Good grief, how can you live with a philosophy like that?&#39;</p>

<p>...&quot;what is there in this world that truly makes living worthwhile?&quot;</p>
<p>Death thought about it.</p>
<p>CATS, he said eventually. CATS ARE NICE.”

<p>“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.”
― Terry Pratchett, A Hat Full of Sky </p>
<h3 id="evil">Evil</h3>
<p>The Patrician took a sip of his beer. &quot;I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I&#39;m sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to its day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature&#39;s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. And that&#39;s when I first learned about evil. It is built in to the very nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior. Terry Pratchett, Unseen Academicals.</p>
